# Choice of our predictors and target

After joining the grocery dataset with the children obesity one on the area_id, we obtained a DataFrame with 202 potential predictors and 7 labels for only 544 datapoints.

We had to select the correct predictors and the correct target. Indeed, our model will surely overfit with 202 predictors for a sample of size 544.

As the dataset is based on London, we decided to follow the guidelines of the [National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/causes/) to select our predictors. 
We can note that there are four points that we can extract from the dataset that causes obesity: calories, fat, sugar and alcohol. 
As children of 6 years old are not likely to drink alcohol, we will focus on the 3 columns _fat_, _sugar_ and _energy_tot_
